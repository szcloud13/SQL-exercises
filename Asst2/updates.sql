--  This script takes a "vanilla" imdb database (a2.db) and
--  make all of the changes necessary to make the databas
--  work correctly with your PHP scripts.
--
--  Such changes might involve adding new views,
--  PLpgSQL functions, triggers, etc. Other changes might
--  involve dropping or redefining existing
--  views and functions (if any and if applicable).
--  You are not allowed to create new tables for this assignment.
--
--  Make sure that this script does EVERYTHING necessary to
--  upgrade a vanilla database; if we need to chase you up
--  because you forgot to include some of the changes, and
--  your system will not work correctly because of this, you
--  will lose half of your assignment 2 final mark as penalty.
